# Analytics Dashboard & Data Pipeline

A full-stack order analytics dashboard and data ingestion pipeline built with React, Node.js, and SQLite. It imports orders, product catalogs, and shipments across different formats (JSON, CSV, and XML), normalizes them into a relational database, calculates business metrics, and displays them in an interactive dashboard.

## What It Does

In e-commerce systems, operational data usually arrives from separate sources:
- **Orders in JSON** (customer information, order items, quantities, dates)
- **Products in CSV** (catalog details, categories, base prices)
- **Shipments in XML** (delivery days, carrier statuses, delay records)

This project connects those three streams:
1. **Parses & Cleans**: Handles malformed quoting, BOM tags, and nested structures.
2. **Relational Joins**: Matches orders to their respective products and delivery records.
3. **Calculates Metrics**: Flags delayed orders (> 5 days or marked delayed), computes total order values, and converts currency rates via live European Central Bank data (Frankfurter API).
4. **Visualizes**: Live charts for daily revenue trends, category breakdown, delivery performance, and order tracking tables with date & category filters.

## Live Demo & Offline Support

The frontend is live on Vercel at [analytic-dashboard-iota.vercel.app](https://analytic-dashboard-iota.vercel.app/).

- **Interactive Out-of-the-Box**: Includes an in-browser data simulator so you can test filters, date ranges, and custom JSON imports right away without needing a local backend running.
- **Connect Live Backend**: You can connect a local or hosted backend anytime from the Settings page.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Vite, Recharts, Tailwind CSS, Lucide icons
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, SQLite (`better-sqlite3`), Multer
- **Parsers**: `csv-parse`, `fast-xml-parser`
- **External APIs**: Frankfurter API (currency exchange), REST Countries

## Getting Started Locally

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KushagraDwivedics/Analytic-dashboard.git
cd Analytic-dashboard
```

### 2. Start the Backend API
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```
The API will start at `http://localhost:5000`. You can verify it by opening `http://localhost:5000/api/health`.

### 3. Start the Frontend
In a new terminal:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.
